Just an example of an additional docs folder.

Surprised that it doesn't have a left sidebar menu? Worry not; just [follow this instructions to enable it](../docs/compose/organize-content/#documentation).

<!-- That content is better than dummy lorem ipsum 2) That content serves a good real-world demo for this theme 3) Publish more structured docs for each theme which are better than long blocky READMEs -->

{{< button "./example" "Tutorials" "mb-1" >}}

{{< button "../docs/" "Back to docs" >}}
