LOLDrivers provides comprehensive Sigma, Yara, ClamAV and Sysmon detection rules to help you effectively detect potential threats. To explore these rules in detail, navigate to the [sigma](detections/sigma/), [yara](detections/yara), [av](https://github.com/magicsword-io/LOLDrivers/blob/main/detections/av/LOLDrivers.hdb) and [sysmon](detections/sysmon/) directories under the detection folder. Also there is [WDAC](detections/wdac/) policy thanks to [Florian Stosse](https://github.com/Harvester57) and [HotCakeX](https://github.com/HotCakeX).

## üîé Windows Folder Scanning

The community has also created a PowerShell LOLDriver scanner courtesy of [@Oddvarmoe](https://twitter.com/Oddvarmoe), [@M_haggis](https://twitter.com/M_haggis), and [IISResetMe](https://twitter.com/IISResetMe), that can help you identify potentially malicious drivers. The script, available [here](https://gist.github.com/IISResetMe/1a8353ae57710868b31b0e8d41683b95), allows you to scan a specified Windows folder for any suspicious files. We recommend running the script on directories such as:

```
C:\WINDOWS\inf
C:\WINDOWS\System32\drivers
C:\WINDOWS\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository
```
