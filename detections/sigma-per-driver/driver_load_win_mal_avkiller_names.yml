status: experimental
description: |
    Detects loading of driver avkiller.sys via name.
    Sophos, from time to time, has observed a threat actor deploy variants
        of Poortry on different machines within a single estate during an attack. These
        variants contain the same payload, but signed with a different certificate than
        the driver first seen used during the attack.
