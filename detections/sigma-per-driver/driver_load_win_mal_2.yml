title: Driver Load - 2.sys
id: cfa1146f-6357-5526-b1aa-391ccb36b94b
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects loading of driver 2.sys via hash.
    Sophos, from time to time, has observed a threat actor deploy variants of Poortry on different machines within a single estate during an attack. These variants contain the same payload, but signed with a different certificate than the driver first seen used during the attack.
