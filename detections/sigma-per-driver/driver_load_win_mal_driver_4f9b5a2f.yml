id: 5c370017-2708-5ad1-8d78-fd4f0328cc55
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects loading of driver driver_4f9b5a2f.sys via hash.
    Sophos, from time to time, has observed a threat actor deploy variants of Poortry on different machines within a single estate during an attack. These variants contain the same payload, but signed with a different certificate than the driver first seen used during the attack.
