    Detects loading of driver ACPIx86.sys via hash.
    ABYSSWORKER is a malicious driver used in MEDUSA ransomware attacks to disable EDR systems. The driver masquerades as a legitimate CrowdStrike Falcon driver and provides extensive capabilities to terminate processes, remove security callbacks, manipulate files, and disable security tools. It uses stolen certificates from Chinese companies and requires a specific password for activation. The driver was observed being deployed alongside HEARTCRYPT-packed loaders and provides attackers with kernel-level capabilities to blind EDR products by removing notification callbacks, detaching mini-filter devices, and replacing driver major functions.
