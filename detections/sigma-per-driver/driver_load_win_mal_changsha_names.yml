status: experimental
description: |
    Detects loading of driver changsha via name.
    Malicious rootkit masquerading as legitimate CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor driver (CSAgent.sys). Signed with stolen/expired Chinese certificate from 2015. Detected by 61.6% of AV engines as Rootkit.Win64.Agent and Trojan:Win64/AVTamper. Used to establish kernel-level persistence while evading detection by impersonating trusted security software.
