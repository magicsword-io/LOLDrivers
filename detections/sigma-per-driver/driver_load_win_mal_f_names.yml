title: Driver Load - f.sys
id: da489e4c-a7f6-5ed7-a2f1-a0b04c2b9561
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects loading of driver f.sys via name.
    Sophos, from time to time, has observed a threat actor deploy variants
        of Poortry on different machines within a single estate during an attack. These
        variants contain the same payload, but signed with a different certificate than
        the driver first seen used during the attack.
