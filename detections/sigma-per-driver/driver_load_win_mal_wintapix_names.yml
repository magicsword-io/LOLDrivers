description: |
    Detects loading of driver WinTapix.sys via name.
    Wintapix.sys is partially protected by VMProtect, a software protection tool that uses virtualization to protect software applications from reverse engineering and unauthorized usage. It transforms the original executable file into a virtualized code executed in a protected environment, making it difficult to analyze and tamper with.
