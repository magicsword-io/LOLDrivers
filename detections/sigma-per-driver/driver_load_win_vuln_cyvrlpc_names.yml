    Detects loading of driver cyvrlpc.sys via name.
    Per Sophos X-Ops research
    (Aug 06, 2025), threat actors deploy an EDR-killer that loads a malicious
    kernel driver (often with a random five-letter name) signed with
    compromised or revoked code-signing certificates (e.g., Changsha Hengxiang
    Information Technology; Fuzhou Dingxin Trade). The tool targets many
    security products by killing their services and processes and is frequently
    distributed packed with HeartCrypt by ransomware groups (e.g., RansomHub,
    INC). Driver names are hard-coded per sample (e.g., mraml.sys, noedt.sys).
