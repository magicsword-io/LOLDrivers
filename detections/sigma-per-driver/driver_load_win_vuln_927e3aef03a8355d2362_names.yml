    Detects loading of driver 927e3aef03a8355d236230cace376b3023480a40c5ac08453c07dab343dd1f11 via name.
    According to Sophos X-Ops
    (Aug 06, 2025), a widely shared EDR-killer toolkit drops/loads a malicious
    kernel driver signed with compromised or revoked certificates to disable
    endpoint protections. Variants target many vendors, and are commonly
    HeartCrypt-packed and used by ransomware groups (e.g., RansomHub, INC).
    The payload uses hard-coded driver names (e.g., mraml.sys, noedt.sys) and
    kills security services/processes.
