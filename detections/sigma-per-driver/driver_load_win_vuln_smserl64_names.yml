title: Driver Load - SmSerl64.sys
id: da262dff-d36b-5dc1-bf5d-f52688a86f20
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects loading of driver SmSerl64.sys via name.
    A vulnerability exits in driver SmSerl64.sys in Motorola SM56 Modem WDM Driver v6.12.23.0, which allows low-privileged users to mapping physical memory via specially crafted IOCTL requests . This can be exploited for privilege escalation, code execution under high privileges, and information disclosure. These signed drivers can also be used to bypass the Microsoft driver-signing policy to deploy malicious code.
