    Detects loading of driver blacklotus_driver.sys via name.
    The first in-the-wild UEFI bootkit bypassing UEFI Secure Boot on fully updated UEFI systems is now a reality. Once the persistence is configured, the BlackLotus bootkit is executed on every system start. The bootkits goal is to deploy a kernel driver and a final user-mode component.
