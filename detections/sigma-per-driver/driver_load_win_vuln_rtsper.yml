    Detects loading of driver RtsPer.sys via hash.
    The Realtek SD card reader driver, RtsPer.sys, has been found to contain multiple critical vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-25476, CVE-2022-25477, CVE-2022-25478, CVE-2022-25479, CVE-2022-25480, CVE-2024-40431, CVE-2024-40432) that allow non-privileged users to leak kernel memory, write to arbitrary kernel memory, and access physical memory via DMA. These flaws affect various SD card reader models (including RTS5227, RTS5228, RTS522A, RTS5249, RTS524A, RTS5250, RTS525A, RTS5287, RTS5260, RTS5261, RTS5264) used by major OEMs such as Dell, Lenovo, HP, and MSI. The vulnerabilities enable kernel memory leaks, arbitrary kernel memory writes, PCI configuration space manipulation, and DMA controller access from user mode. Due to the driver's widespread use, the impact is significant, potentially allowing privilege escalation and system compromise. Realtek has addressed these issues in driver version 10.0.26100.21374 or higher, released in July or August.
