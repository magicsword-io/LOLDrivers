    Detects loading of driver BioNTdrv.sys via name.
    Microsoft has identified five security flaws in the Paragon Partition Manager BioNTdrv.sys driver, one of which was exploited by ransomware gangs in zero-day attacks to gain SYSTEM privileges on Windows systems. These vulnerabilities, found in BioNTdrv.sys versions 1.3.0 and 1.5.1, enable attackers to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM level to a higher access level than standard administrator permissions.
